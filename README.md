Food Munch | Responsive web page
Food Munch is a simple and responsive food ordering website created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. This project shows a modern food delivery landing page where users can explore different food categories, view offers, and understand delivery and payment options.

The website includes a navigation bar, banner section, “Why Choose Us” section, explore menu section, healthy food section, delivery and payment details, customer appreciation section, follow us section, and a footer with contact information. The design is mobile-friendly and works well on different screen sizes.

This project helped me improve my skills in HTML structure, CSS styling, Bootstrap layout system, and responsive web design. It is created for learning and practice purposes.

To run this project, download or clone the repository and open the index.html file in any web browser.

Technologies used in this project are HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4, Google Fonts, and Font Awesome.
